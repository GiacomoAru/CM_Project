This zip archive contains 3 Python files, including all the functions used for the project. 
The file low_rank_approximation.py contains our implementation of the algorithm, with the start function to initiate the iterative process. 
The file math_utils.py includes functions used during the project that are not strictly necessary for our implementation 
but serve as supporting methods, such as tools for OTS implementation or methods to initialize matrices with specific desired properties. 
The file plot_utils.py contains the functions used to visualize and manage data, as well as to create the plots. 
Lastly, it also includes the latest version of the report, consistent with the one sent in the email, 
where we corrected a minor error in the description of a plot.
